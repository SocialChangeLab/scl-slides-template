# Social Change Lab: Quarto Slides Template ðŸ“ˆ

## Installing

```bash
quarto use template SocialChangeLab/scl-slides-template
```

This will install the extension in a new directory and create a `template.qmd` file with the name you supplied that you can use as a starting place for your revealjs slides.

Alternatively, you can also add the extension only to an existing project:

```bash
quarto add SocialChangeLab/scl-slides-template
```

Make sure to add a `_quarto.yml` to the home directory to make the extension available to all .qmd files in children directories. The `_quarto.yml` should include: 

```yaml
format:
  scl-revealjs: default
```




## Example

Here is the source code for the sample slides: [template.qmd](template.qmd)

And the rendered slides: [template.html](https://socialchangelab.github.io/scl-slides-template)
